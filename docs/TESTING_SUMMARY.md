- **Build Web**: Web build (artifact retained 7 days)
- **Code Quality**: TODO scanning, file size checks, dependency audit

#### 2. Coverage Badge (`coverage_badge.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main

**Features:**
- Extracts coverage percentage
- Updates dynamic badge via Gist
- Posts coverage comment on PRs

### Supporting Scripts
- `scripts/coverage_report.sh`: Local coverage reporting
- `.github/BADGES.md`: Badge templates for README
- `.github/CI_CD_SETUP.md`: Complete setup guide

## 🎯 Testing Patterns & Best Practices

### 1. Model Testing Pattern
```dart
group('ModelName', () {
  test('creates model correctly', () { ... });
  test('converts to and from Map correctly', () { ... });
  test('copyWith creates modified copy', () { ... });
  test('handles null/edge cases', () { ... });
});
```

### 2. Service Testing Pattern
```dart
group('ServiceName', () {
  setUp(() {
    // Initialize test data
  });

  test('method works with valid input', () { ... });
  test('method handles edge cases', () { ... });
  test('method throws on invalid input', () { ... });
});
```

### 3. Widget Testing Pattern
```dart
testWidgets('widget description', (WidgetTester tester) async {
  await tester.pumpWidget(createTestWidget());

  expect(find.byType(WidgetType), findsOneWidget);
  expect(find.text('Expected Text'), findsOneWidget);

  await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.icon_name));
  await tester.pumpAndSettle();

  expect(stateChanged, isTrue);
});
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Failing Tests (40)
**Location:** `test/widget/auth_screen_widget_test.dart`, `test/widget/main_app_widget_test.dart`

**Cause:** Complex Firebase dependencies require mocking or emulator setup

**Impact:** Does not affect new test infrastructure

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up Firebase Test Lab or emulator
2. Implement comprehensive mocking strategy
3. Consider integration tests for Firebase-dependent code

### Coverage Gaps
**Services with 0% coverage:**
- UserProfileService
- AuthService (complex Firebase Auth flows)
- AnalyticsService

**Screens with minimal coverage:**
- Badge/Leaderboard screens (new features)
- Chat screens (Firebase dependencies)
- Calendar screen (complex date handling)

## 📈 Roadmap to 80% Coverage

### Week 2 Target: 40% Coverage
- [ ] Fix 40 failing tests (Auth BLoC, widget tests)
- [ ] Add widget tests for Badge/Leaderboard screens (20 tests)
- [ ] Add tests for UserProfileService (15 tests)
- [ ] Add tests for remaining RecommendationService methods (10 tests)

### Week 3 Target: 60% Coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for user flows (30 tests)
  - Login → Home → Bookmark flow
  - Profile → Edit → Save flow
  - Chat → Search → Message flow
- [ ] Add tests for complex widgets (15 tests)
- [ ] Add tests for BLoC state management (20 tests)

### Week 4 Target: 80% Coverage
- [ ] Add tests for remaining services (25 tests)
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests (10 tests)
- [ ] Performance tests for critical paths
- [ ] Security tests for auth flows

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Model-first testing**: Testing models without Firebase dependencies was fast and reliable
2. **Isolated widget tests**: Testing simple widgets in isolation provided quick wins
3. **Comprehensive test groups**: Organizing tests by feature area improved maintainability
4. **CI/CD early**: Setting up automation early caught formatting issues

### Challenges
1. **Firebase dependencies**: Mocking Firebase requires significant setup
2. **Widget test complexity**: Testing widgets with providers/BLoCs is more complex
3. **Coverage calculation**: Different tools give slightly different results
4. **Test naming**: Maintaining consistent naming across 200+ tests

### Improvements for Next Iteration
1. Set up Firebase emulator for integration tests
2. Create test helper utilities for common setup
3. Document testing patterns in developer guide
4. Add pre-commit hooks for test execution
