## NOTES

1. **Documentation Dates:** Many docs show future dates (Sept 2025). These need correction.

2. **Budget Reality Check:** PRD claims 4.5M MAD budget, but current implementation is ~30% complete. Need honest reassessment.

3. **Feature Creep:** Documents describe features way beyond MVP. Focus on core value first.

4. **Team Resources:** Verify if current team size matches ambitious timelines in PMP-015.

5. **Firebase Limits:** Current architecture is Firebase-only. May need to scale to dedicated backend for enterprise features.

**Next Action:** Review this TODO with team and create sprint backlog from P0 items.
