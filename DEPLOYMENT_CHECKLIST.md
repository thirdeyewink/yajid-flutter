- [ ] Wait for indexes to build (can take 5-30 minutes)

#### Step 3.2: Verify Indexes
- [ ] Open Firebase Console → Firestore → Indexes
- [ ] Confirm all composite indexes show "Enabled"
- [ ] Check for any index build failures

### Phase 4: Flutter App Testing

#### Step 4.1: Test Gamification Flow
- [ ] Run app: `flutter run`
- [ ] Sign in with test account
- [ ] Award points by performing an action (bookmark a recommendation)
- [ ] Verify points displayed in app bar
- [ ] Check leaderboard updates automatically
- [ ] Navigate to badge showcase
- [ ] Verify badges unlock correctly
- [ ] Check points history timeline

#### Step 4.2: Monitor Cloud Functions
```bash
firebase functions:log
```
- [ ] Verify awardPoints function executes
- [ ] Check for any errors in logs
- [ ] Confirm execution time < 500ms
- [ ] Verify updateLeaderboard trigger fires

#### Step 4.3: Test Core Features
- [ ] Test authentication (email, Google, Apple)
- [ ] Test user profile creation/editing
- [ ] Test recommendation browsing and filtering
- [ ] Test chat functionality
- [ ] Test language switching (5 languages)
- [ ] Test dark/light theme switching
- [ ] Test venue search (if UI complete)

### Phase 5: Production Build

#### Step 5.1: Build Android APK
```bash
flutter build apk --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/debug
```
- [ ] Confirm successful build
- [ ] Note APK size
- [ ] Test APK on physical device

#### Step 5.2: Build Android App Bundle (for Play Store)
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/debug
```
- [ ] Confirm successful build
- [ ] Upload to Play Store Internal Testing

#### Step 5.3: Build iOS (if applicable)
```bash
flutter build ios --release --obfuscate --split-debug-info=build/debug
```
- [ ] Confirm successful build
- [ ] Upload to TestFlight

#### Step 5.4: Build Web
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
- [ ] Confirm successful build
