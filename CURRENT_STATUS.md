### ⚠️ Blockers

- [ ] **Firebase Blaze Plan Upgrade** (CRITICAL - BLOCKING)
  - Current: Spark (free) plan
  - Required: Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan
  - Cost: $0-5/month for 10K-50K users
  - Action: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/yajid-connect/usage/details

### 📋 Post-Blaze Actions

1. Deploy Cloud Functions (`firebase deploy --only functions`)
2. Deploy Firestore Rules (`firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`)
3. Test gamification flow end-to-end
4. Monitor Cloud Functions logs
5. Verify zero errors

---

## 💰 Cost Projections

### Firebase Blaze Plan (Monthly)

| Users | Function Calls | Firestore Ops | **Cost** |
|-------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| 1K | ~300K | ~500K | **$0.00** (free tier) |
| 5K | ~1.5M | ~2.5M | **$0.00** (free tier) |
| 10K | ~3M | ~5M | **$0.40** |
| 50K | ~15M | ~25M | **$5.20** |
| 100K | ~30M | ~50M | **$11.20** |

**Recommendation:** Set billing alerts at $10, $25, $50/month
