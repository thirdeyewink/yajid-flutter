### Critical Inconsistencies Found

#### 1. README.md Branding Mismatch
**Issue:** README describes project as "social media and recommendation platform"
**Reality:** PRD-001 defines it as "Lifestyle & Social Discovery Super App"
**Impact:** Investor/user messaging confusion
**Status:** ⚠️ PENDING UPDATE

#### 2. Git Version Control Gap
**Issue:** 120 production-ready files were untracked in git
**Files Affected:**
- All gamification models, services, BLoC, UI (15+ files)
- Cloud Functions (4 TypeScript files, 942 total lines)
- Venue/booking/payment infrastructure (15+ files)
- Core utilities (validators, secure storage, error handling)
- All test files (25+ test files)
- All documentation (29 markdown files)

**Impact:** 48,476 lines of code at risk of loss
**Resolution:** ✅ COMMITTED in commit 825e4ea

#### 3. Implementation Status Documents
**Issue:** IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_FINAL.md claims "Production-Ready" but files weren't committed
**Resolution:** ✅ Now aligned - files committed, status accurate

#### 4. Cloud Functions Deployment Status
**Documented:** "Ready to deploy, pending Blaze plan"
**Verified:** ✅ Accurate - functions compiled with 0 errors
**Blocker:** Firebase Spark plan (requires Blaze upgrade)
**Cost:** $0-5/month for 10K-50K users
**Action Required:** Upgrade at https://console.firebase.google.com/project/yajid-connect/usage/details

- OnboardingProvider

**Assessment:** Clean separation, consistent patterns, scalable

### Backend Architecture

**Firebase Cloud Functions (TypeScript):**
```
functions/src/
├── index.ts (28 lines) - Entry point
└── gamification/
    ├── awardPoints.ts (377 lines)
    ├── updateLeaderboard.ts (207 lines)
    └── checkBadgeUnlocks.ts (358 lines)
```

**Total:** 970 lines of production TypeScript code
